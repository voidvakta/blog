# Personal Blog Web App
This is a fully functional blog application built using Flask as the backend framework, MySQL as the database, and HTML, CSS, and JavaScript as the frontend technologies. The app allows for CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on blog posts, comments, and user profiles.

## Features
- User registration and authentication system
- Create, Read, Update, and Delete blog posts for admin users
- View all blog posts on the home page
- View individual blog posts with comments
- Add and delete comments on blog posts for admin users

## Technologies Used
- Flask
- MySQL
- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript

## Installation
1. Clone the repository from GitHub:
        
        git clone https://github.com/Siddharth-2382/Personal-Blog-Web-App.git
2. Install the required packages:
        
        cd Personal-Blog-Web-App
        pip install -r requirements.txt
3. Run the application:
        
        python main.py

## Usage
Once the app is running, open a web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:5000/`. From there, you can register for a new account, log in to an existing account, and start using the app to create and manage blog posts.<br />
**Note:** The first account created will be used as the `admin` account. Also, I have pushed the code with sqllite model, so feel free to change links to your MySql database.
